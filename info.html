			<h2>About this Website</h2>
			<p>This website a Web application that allows authenticated users -- possibly families or couples -- to manage resources related to the care of a child (from babies and preschoolers to puberty). The calendar of feeding, sleeping hours, various multimedia resources (photos, films, audio recordings,...) regarding the child's evolution, medical history, relationship with other children (e.g., cousins, kindergarten/school colleagues), etc. will be targeted. The application will provide a chronological view (timeline) of the most important captured moments related to each individual child, with the possibility of sharing the most significant moments within a social application or via an RSS news feed.</p>
